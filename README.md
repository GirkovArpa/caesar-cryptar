# CaesarCryptar

The Caesar cipher, compiled with Free Pascal using the Key Objects Library (KOL) and Mirror Classes Kit (MCK).

This project marks the beginning of my forray into the Lazarus IDE.  With its convenient drag-and-drop interface, it's easy to create very tiny yet very functional Windows executables without external dependencies.  

This particular program, without the icon, is a mere ~50KB.

That's over 30x smaller than using the regular Lazarus control library, and over 100x smaller than using C++ Builder's VCL library.

It's probably possible to reduce the size from 50KB to 3KB by writing directly for the Win32 API without the help of a WYSIWYG IDE.

But I'm not about that lyfe.
